 was in the clipboard to remind me to work with an issue template for this repo.

 - [ ] #3 See this issue for more ideas
 - [ ] Pick the best Youtubes from #git...2016 to pitch github for Dan et al
 - [ ] Add links to the wiki, website, etc.
 - [ ] Wonky task list?  Add this wonky list to the web page somewhere.
 - [ ] No save button means it saves work automatically?  No, see the blue dot?
 - [ ] Learn to use ctrl s
 - [x] Create the wiki default, a website(?) and a definition.
 - [x] Next on the list might be to restrict all branches to require approval (pull request).

 - [x] modified and merged the branch with a pull request.  So don't use this test branch anymore.
 - [x] this is a task list?  I need an issue template.
